Spring makes it easy to create Java enterprise applications. It provides everything you need to embrace the Java language in an enterprise environment, with support for Groovy and Kotlin as alternative languages on the JVM, and with the flexibility to create many kinds of architectures depending on an applicationâ€™s needs. As of Spring Framework 5.0, Spring requires JDK 8+ (Java SE 8+) and provides out-of-the-box support for JDK 9 already.
